# Arduino library for ultrasonic sensors like HC-SR04
## Main Features
- max distance and min distance of the sensor can be configured and will be considered in calculation
- based on sensor hardware, measurement interval can be configured
- timeout of sensor is based on max distance
- get distance in different metrics
- simple check if obstacle is in given range
